GDG Bootstrap v0.02
http://developers.google.com/groups

Created by Joshua Woodward http://joshuawoodward.com/+
Contribution from Friedger MÃ¼ffke https://plus.google.com/107100127479392600261

Includes jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, and a JavaScript Date Formatter - License all inside

How do I use it?
Go to Google Developer API console (https://code.google.com/apis/console/) and create a project, or use existing one, that has the Google+ Service turned on. You will need an API Key to get "About" and "Photo" sections to work.

Open /js/gdg.js and modify the config lines 3-5, with your GDG Name, Google+ Profile ID (Use your chapters +Page, not your personal), and API Key

Should just work ...

v 0.3
Added two config options.

cover_photo (boolean) - determines if you want to use cover photo from google+ chapter page, currently best if you use a 940x180 image

cover_color (css color) - custom font color option for cover photo, for dark pictures

Added "Join" link - if users is logged into Google, will automagically mark the "I'm a member button", otherwise does nothing.

Minified dateFormat.js

v 0.2
Added bootstrap-responsive.min.css
